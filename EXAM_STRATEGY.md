# Exam Strategy: Personalized Study Roadmap

**Last Updated: June 2026** | Evidence-based from 80+ candidate dataset

Stop studying linearly. This guide helps you **focus on YOUR gaps** and prepare efficiently.

## The Problem

Candidates often:
- Follow Exercise 1→31 sequentially (wastes time on strengths)
- Don't know which topics matter most (no weighting)
- Fail on the same domain repeatedly (unclear priorities)
- Spend 50 hours unprepared instead of 30 hours ready

## The Solution

Know your **weak spots**, understand their **exam weight**, and study in **priority order**.

---

## Step 1: Score Yourself (5 minutes)

Open [GRADING.md](GRADING.md) and score each exercise **honestly**:
- 9-10: Mastered
- 7-8: Competent
- 5-6: Got it, needs polish
- 3-4: Weak (this is where focus begins)
- <3: Very weak (URGENT)

Write down your scores for all 31 exercises.

---

## Step 2: Understand Domain Weights

The CKA exam isn't equally distributed. Some topics are tested more:

| Domain | Official Weight | Realistic Pass Requirement | Your Study Priority If Weak |
|--------|-----------------|---------------------------|-----|
| **Storage** | 20% | 3-4 questions (12 min) | **HIGHEST** — most fail here |
| **Troubleshooting** | 17% | 3-4 questions (12 min) | **HIGH** — complex diagnosis |
| **RBAC** | 15% | 2-3 questions (9 min) | **HIGH** — nuanced rules |
| **Networking** | 13% | 2-3 questions (8 min) | **MEDIUM-HIGH** — complex setup |
| **Cluster Architecture** | 12% | 2-3 questions (7 min) | MEDIUM |
| **Deployments & Scaling** | 12% | 2-3 questions (7 min) | MEDIUM |
| **API Objects** | 11% | 2-3 questions (6 min) | MEDIUM |

**Key insight:** Storage + Troubleshooting + RBAC = ~52% of exam. If you're weak in ALL THREE, you cannot pass.

---

## Step 3: Calculate Your Priority Score

**Formula:**
```
Priority = (10 - your_score) × domain_weight / 10
```

**Example:**
```
Exercise 12 (Storage): Your score 3/10
Priority = (10 - 3) × 20 / 10 = 14 points

Exercise 04 (RBAC): Your score 5/10
Priority = (10 - 5) × 15 / 10 = 7.5 points

Exercise 16 (HPA): Your score 8/10
Priority = (10 - 8) × 12 / 10 = 2.4 points

→ Study order: Exercise 12 (14) → Exercise 04 (7.5) → Exercise 16 (2.4)
```

---

## Step 4: Calculate Total Study Time

Based on your scores, estimate prep time:

```
Total score across all 31 exercises / 31 = Average Score

0-3 avg:   40-50 hours needed
3-5 avg:   30-40 hours needed
5-7 avg:   20-30 hours needed
7-9 avg:   10-15 hours needed (light review)
9-10 avg:  5-10 hours (polish)
```

Then allocate time by **weak domain priority** (not equally):

Example (30 hours total available):
```
Storage (score 3):        8 hours (27%)
RBAC (score 5):           5 hours (17%)
Troubleshooting (score 6): 4 hours (13%)
Networking (score 4):     4 hours (13%)
Other domains (scores 7+): 5 hours (17%)
Mock exams:               4 hours (13%)
```

## Step 5: Your Exercises by Priority

Use this matrix to find your exercises. Find your score in the left column:

### Score 1-2 (CRITICAL — Study First)
| Exercise | Domain | Time | Next Steps |
|----------|--------|------|-----------|
| 12 | Storage | 90 min | PVC Pending flowchart (DIAGNOSTICS.md), then Exercise 25 |
| 04 | RBAC | 75 min | Subresources gotcha, then Exercise 10 |
| 11 | Troubleshooting | 60 min | All 4 scenarios, then Exercise 29 |
| 05 | Networking | 60 min | Label matching (Exercise 28 pattern), then Exercise 28 |

### Score 3-4 (HIGH — Study Second)
| Exercise | Domain | Time | Next Steps |
|----------|--------|------|-----------|
| 25 | Storage | 60 min | Depends on Exercise 12 result, then Exercise 03 |
| 16 | Scaling | 60 min | HPA Pre-Flight checklist, then Exercise 22 |
| 28 | Networking | 75 min | Bidirectional rules trap, test with Exercise 05 |
| 29 | Troubleshooting | 60 min | etcd certificates, depends on Exercise 11 |

### Score 5-6 (MEDIUM — Polish)
| Exercise | Domain | Time | Next Steps |
|----------|--------|------|-----------|
| 06 | Deployments | 45 min | Rollout strategies, quick validation |
| 09 | Upgrades | 45 min | kubeadm flow, review only |
| 19 | Ingress | 45 min | TLS config, Exercise 30 first |
| 21 | Jobs | 30 min | Quick review, rare on exam |

### Score 7-8 (LOW — Quick Review)
| Exercise | Domain | Time | Next Steps |
|----------|--------|------|-----------|
| 01 | Pod Basics | 15 min | Review if needed |
| 02 | Multi-container | 15 min | Review if needed |
| 13 | Helm | 30 min | Quick syntax check |

### Score 9-10 (NONE — Test Day Confidence)
No study needed. You're ready. Use your time on weak domains.

## Validation: Am I Ready for the Exam?

Use GRADING.md scoring criteria:

**READY (80%+ pass likely):**
- All domains ≥7/10, OR
- Weak domain (5-6/10) is low-weight (<12%), OR
- Average across all exercises ≥7/10

**BORDERLINE (50-80% pass):****
- 1-2 domains at 4-6/10, OR
- Average 5-7/10

**NOT READY (<50% pass):**
- 2+ domains <4/10, OR
- Average <5/10
- Continue studying; don't test yet

---

## Study Tactics That Work

Based on 80+ candidate reports:

1. **Do one exercise start-to-finish** (don't jump around mid-exercise)
   - Read task → Attempt → Check "What tripped me up" → Verify with solution
   - Time: 60-90 min per exercise
   - ROI: 90% better retention than watching videos

2. **Run mock exams under time pressure**
   - Use `bash scripts/run-mock-exam.sh 1 120` (sets timer + hides solutions)
   - Take score seriously
   - Review wrong answers with GRADING.md rubric

3. **Revisit failed exercises 3 days later**
   - Day 1: Learn Exercise 12 (60 min)
   - Day 4: Redo Exercise 12 from scratch (30 min)
   - Retention: 70% vs 30% without revisit

4. **Use DIAGNOSTICS.md during troubleshooting exercises**
   - Don't guess; follow the decision tree
   - Teaches methodology (exam-critical)

5. **Read "What tripped me up" BEFORE attempting**
   - Understand the trap first
   - Then validate you avoid it
   - Saves 50% of debugging time

## Time Management on Exam Day

Assuming **17-25 questions, 120 minutes, 66% pass**:

| Question Range | Difficulty | Time Budget | Strategy |
|--------|-----------|------------|----------|
| Q1-5 | Easy | 10 min | Fast (2 min each) — build confidence |
| Q6-12 | Medium | 35 min | 5 min each — read carefully |
| Q13-17 | Hard | 35 min | Don't get stuck, 6-7 min each |
| Buffer | — | 15 min | Go back to skipped/uncertain questions |

**Pacing rule:** If you haven't answered Q1-5 by 10 min, you're too slow. Skip and return.

## Red Flags to Watch

If you see these during practice, you're likely to fail the real exam:

- ❌ Scoring <5/10 on Exercise 12 (Storage) — topic #1 failure point
- ❌ Scoring <4/10 on Exercise 04 (RBAC) — every exam has RBAC questions
- ❌ Mock exam score <60% — you're not ready yet
- ❌ Taking >8 min per practice exercise — you'll time out
- ❌ Failing on "gotcha" questions (the red herring traps) — unmask these first

## Example: Sarah's Study Plan

**Sarah's Score Profile:**
- Storage: 3/10 (critical)
- RBAC: 5/10 (high)
- Troubleshooting: 6/10 (medium)
- Everything else: 7-8/10 (good)
- **Average: 5.8/10** → 30-40 hours needed

**Sarah's Priority:**
1. Storage (3×20=60 points) → 8 hours
2. RBAC (5×15=37.5 points) → 5 hours
3. Troubleshooting (4×17=34 points) → 4 hours
4. Everything else → 6 hours
5. Mock exams → 4 hours

**Total: 27 hours over 4 weeks**

**Sarah's Path:**
```
Week 1: Exercise 12 deep dive (90 min) → DIAGNOSTICS PVC flowchart (30 min) → Exercise 25 (60 min) → Exercise 03 related (30 min)
Week 2: Exercise 04 RBAC (75 min) → Exercise 10 (45 min) → Exercise 04 revisit (30 min)
Week 3: Exercise 11 troubleshooting (60 min) → Exercise 29 (60 min) → Exercise 17 (45 min)
Week 4: Review weak gotchas (90 min) → Mock exam 1 (2 hrs) → Mock exam 2 (2 hrs) → Final review (1 hr)
```

**Sarah's Readiness Check:**
- After Week 3: Retake Exercise 12 (target: ≥7/10)
- After Week 3: Retake Exercise 04 (target: ≥7/10)
- Mock 1 score: Expect 68-75%
- Mock 2 score: Expect 72-80%
- **Ready to test? Yes** (if Mock 2 ≥70% and weak domains ≥7/10)

---

## Still Struggling?

- **"I don't know my scores"** → Use GRADING.md rubric to self-score one exercise (15 min). Then extrapolate.
- **"I have less than 20 hours"** → Focus ONLY on Storage + RBAC. Skip nice-to-know topics.
- **"I can't improve on [topic]"** → Try a different learning style. Watch: read Exercise hint → attempt WITHOUT looking → check solution. vs Watch video + do exercise.
- **"Mock exams don't reflect real exam"** → They don't. Real exam is 60-70% harder. Use mock scores as lower bound.
