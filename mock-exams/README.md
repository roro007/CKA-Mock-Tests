# Mock Exams — CKA Practice Tests

Two comprehensive practice exams that simulate real CKA exam conditions. These are **timed, full-length practice tests** designed to identify your weak areas before attempting the real CKA exam.

## Quick Start

### Easiest Way: Use the Timed Exam Runner

```bash
# Start Mock Exam 01 with countdown timer (120 minutes)
bash scripts/run-mock-exam.sh 1

# Or Mock Exam 02
bash scripts/run-mock-exam.sh 2

# Or shorten to 90 minutes for a quick test
bash scripts/run-mock-exam.sh 1 90
```

The script will:
- ✅ Show all questions
- ✅ Start a countdown timer (red warning in last 5 min)
- ✅ Remind you to save answers in `/tmp/cka-exam-answers/`
- ✅ Show solutions after exam

### Manual Approach (If Preferred)

1. **Read the questions file ONLY** — Do not open solutions until complete
2. **Set a 2-hour timer** — This is exam length; stick to it
3. **Solve in real Kubernetes cluster** — Use your kubeadm cluster or managed k8s
4. **Verify each solution** — Use `kubectl get`, `describe`, `logs`, etc.
5. **Finish or time expires** — Mark incomplete questions and move on
6. **Score and review** — Compare against solutions file
7. **Analyze mistakes** — Identify pattern (RBAC? Storage? Networking?)

## Exam Scoring

| Score | Interpretation | Next Step |
|-------|-----------------|-----------|
| **15/15** | Perfect — ready for real exam | Take second mock, then schedule real exam |
| **12-14/15** | Passing (80%+) — likely ready | Review missed questions, schedule real exam |
| **10-11/15** | Minimum passing (67-73%) — borderline | Review all solutions, redo weak domain exercises, retake mock |
| **9/15** | Below passing — needs work | Study the solutions, redo exercises in failed domains, retake mock |
| **<9/15** | Significant gaps — not ready | Review fundamentals, redo exercises, retake mock after 1+ week |

**Real CKA exam passing score:** 66% (10/15 questions)

These mocks are slightly **harder** than real exams, so scoring 12+/15 on mocks = confident for real exam.

## How to Use

1. **Read ONLY the question file** (MOCK-EXAM-01.md or MOCK-EXAM-02.md)
2. **Set a 2-hour timer** — Do not exceed this time
3. **Solve each question** in your own Kubernetes cluster or practice environment
4. **Keep score** — Track how many questions you complete correctly
5. **Do NOT look at solutions** until after you finish
6. **Review solutions** — Compare your answers against the solution file
7. **Score yourself** — 10+/15 correct = passing (66%), 12+/15 = strong, 15/15 = ready for real exam

## Study Recommendations

### Exam Prep Timeline (Recommended)

**Phase 1 — Foundation (1-2 weeks)**
- Complete exercises 01-10 (basic concepts)
- Take mock exam 01 (diagnostic) — expect lower score
- Review mock solutions, identify gaps

**Phase 2 — Deep Dive (2-3 weeks)**
- Complete exercises 11-31 (advanced topics)
- Complete [GRADING.md](../GRADING.md) self-assessment
- Spend 1+ week on weak areas identified from mock 01

**Phase 3 — Refinement (1 week)**
- Take mock exam 02 (should see improvement)
- Review any remaining weak questions
- Practice timed exercises (pick 3-5 exercises, complete in 15 min each)

**Phase 4 — Final Check (3-5 days)**
- Retake mock exam 01 (verify improvement held)
- If scoring 12+/15 consistently: ready for real exam
- If scoring <12/15: do more targeted practice before scheduling

### Domain-Specific Focus

**If you scored < 60% on:**
- **Cluster Architecture** → Redo exercises 04, 08-10, 18, 26-27, 30
- **Troubleshooting** → Redo exercises 11, 29, review all "What tripped me up" sections
- **Workloads** → Redo exercises 06, 07, 16, 21-23
- **Services & Networking** → Redo exercises 05, 19, 20, 28
- **Storage** → Redo exercises 12, 25

**Critical exercises (make sure these are solid):**
- Exercise 04 (RBAC) — 25% of exam weight
- Exercise 12 (Storage) — 10% of exam weight
- Exercise 28 (NetworkPolicy) — 13% of exam weight

## Tips for Mock Exam Success

### Time Management (Critical)
1. **First 5 min:** Read all 15 questions, circle easy/hard ones
2. **Answer easy first** (5-7 min each) — quick confidence wins
3. **Tackle medium** (8-10 min each) — most of your points
4. **Skip hard** initially (12-15 min each) — revisit if time allows
5. **Last 5 min:** Verify top answers, don't introduce new mistakes

### Problem-Solving Approach
1. **Understand the requirement** — Reread question twice
2. **Design solution** — Sketch YAML mentally before typing
3. **Implement** — Use imperative commands where faster
4. **Verify** — kubectl get/describe/logs to confirm
5. **Move on** — Don't second-guess

### Common Mistakes to Avoid ❌
- ❌ Creating resources without checking for errors
- ❌ Forgetting to test cross-namespace connectivity
- ❌ Misreading pod/service/deployment names
- ❌ Skipping verification (assume it works)
- ❌ Editing wrong file (copy-paste from wrong exercise)
- ❌ Forgetting namespace (default vs specified)
- ❌ Spending too long on one question (5 min? move on)

## Resources During Mock Exams

Keep these open while practicing:

| Resource | When to Use | Location |
|----------|------------|----------|
| **DIAGNOSTICS.md** | Something breaks (Pod Pending, etc.) | Top-level directory |
| **REAL_EXAM_PATTERNS.md** | Understand what patterns to expect | Top-level directory |
| **cka-cheatsheet.md** | Quick reference (commands, syntax) | `cheatsheet/` |
| **DOMAINS.md** | Understand exam focus areas | Top-level directory |
| **kubernetes.io/docs** | Official docs (allowed during exam) | Online |

### Recommended Flow

```
Before Exam:
1. Read REAL_EXAM_PATTERNS.md (know what to expect)
2. Review DOMAINS.md (refresh domain weights)

During Exam:
1. First 5 min: Read questions, reference REAL_EXAM_PATTERNS.md
2. While solving: DIAGNOSTICS.md if stuck
3. Reference: cka-cheatsheet.md for kubectl syntax

After Exam:
1. Score using GRADING.md scale
2. Identify weak domain in DOMAINS.md
3. Do 2-3 related exercises for remediation
4. Retake mock if score < 12/15
```

## After Each Mock Exam

### Scoring Interpretation

Use the scoring table above. Then:

1. **Score 15/15:** You're ready → Take killer.sh, schedule real exam
2. **Score 12-14:** You're borderline → Review failed questions + related exercises
3. **Score 10-11:** You're barely passing → Spend 1+ week on weak domains, retake mock
4. **Score <10:** Not ready → Fundamentals review, redo exercises, retake after 1+ week

### What To Do With Mistakes

For each wrong question:
1. Find it in `MOCK-EXAM-*-SOLUTIONS.md`
2. Read the explanation (why your answer was wrong)
3. Map to related exercise: `DOMAINS.md` shows domain → `exercises/` folder
4. Redo that exercise with gotchas in mind
5. Mark in GRADING.md as "revisited"

### Sample Fix Workflow

```
Q4: "Create NetworkPolicy to deny all ingress"
Answer: Incorrect (forgot to include default-deny egress rule)

Map to domain: Networking (Exercise 05)
Redo: exercises/05-networkpolicy/
Fix: Review "What tripped me up" section
RetestL Take mock again week later

Result: Q4 now scored correctly
```

## Final Exam Day Readiness

Before scheduling real CKA exam, verify:

✅ Scored 12+/15 on both mock exams (or close)
✅ Can consistently diagnose using DIAGNOSTICS.md
✅ Understand domain weights from REAL_EXAM_PATTERNS.md
✅ Passed killer.sh (if available in your cluster)
✅ Refreshed all 7 red-flag exercises (04, 05, 11, 12, 16, 28, 29)

If all ✅ → Schedule exam. You're ready for 85%+ score.

### Success Tips ✓
- ✓ Use imperative commands when possible (faster than YAML)
- ✓ Always verify your work before moving on
- ✓ kubectl get/describe/logs are your debugging friends
- ✓ Use `k get RESOURCE -o yaml` to inspect created resources
- ✓ Test connectivity with `curl`, `wget`, `telnet` where needed
- ✓ Document nothing (you can't copy-paste on real exam)
- ✓ Take breaks between mock exams (at least 2-3 days)

## After Completing Both Mocks

### If you scored 12+/15 on both:
1. **Ready for real exam** — Schedule the CKA exam
2. **Optional:** Try killer.sh (harder than real exam, good confidence booster)
3. **Real exam tips:**
   - Arrive 15 min early for setup
   - Do warm-up questions first (easier ones)
   - Use notepad for question tracking
   - Ask proctor for clarification if unsure
   - Verify each solution explicitly (prod-like rigor)

### If you scored 10-11/15 on both:
1. **Borderline passing** — Proceed with caution
2. **Recommended:** Review all solutions, understand mistakes
3. **Spend 1 week** on weak domain (e.g., RBAC if failed authZ questions)
4. **Take one more mock** (redo the easier of the two)
5. **If 11+/15 again:** Schedule real exam
6. **If <11/15:** More practice needed

### If you scored <10/15 on either mock:
1. **Not ready** — Do not schedule real exam yet
2. **Review solutions thoroughly** — Understand each mistake
3. **Redo weak exercises** — Go back to 01-31 for that domain
4. **Wait 1-2 weeks** — Let concepts soak
5. **Retake mock** (same exam is fine for practice)
6. **When consistently 12+/15:** Schedule real exam
